Okay, lets try and write this out in a coherent fashion, before we even get it into code.

First off, before game begins we can take for granted that there is a word that we have, secret_word.
Intialise some variables:
guesses = 6
warnings = 3
letters_guesed = []

print this stuff off
Welcome to the game Hangman!
I am thinking of a word that is 4(len of secret word) letters long
You have 3 warnings left.

dashed_line
You have 6 guesses left
Available Letters: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
Please guess a letter: a

what to do every time we get an input;
First thing to do is to check that it is a valid guess, using the input.isalpha(), 
	IF it is we do this:
	
	Otherwise:
		Tell user that was not a valid letter.
		Decrease their total warnings by 1
		if the warnings is 0: 
			then decresase guesses by 1
      set warnings = 3
		 and print warnings left and guessed left



At the end of each turn, before any input, we should check if guesses is == 0, or if the word has been guessed
if so then we should 
	end game,
		which involves:
		1. telling the user their score, which is their guesses * number of unique characters in secret word  
      Which can be found through 26 - get_letters available(letters guessed)
    2. Print congratulatory message
  if guess = 0 
    1. print the secret word and tell them they lost
